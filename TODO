TODO:
write tests with Fakeweb
flesh out more resource methods
make post requests with embedded file attachments respond with the file attachments for now...later we need to allow the creation of files in the same way as posts as flat 
  namespaced objects
handle failure states on requests
namespace auth requests to be consistent with other api calls

TODONE:
remove temporary auth setup logging in user automatically

QUESTIONS:
should authentication responses look like query and commit responses namespacing is applied differently in authentication currently?
